WARNING: Other than the modeled parts that I did for the project, I added altered Toolbox parts as well from Solidworks as there was an issue with my assembly file, regarding saving these alterations. So, I added these in the Models file just in case if these alterations weren't shown in the assembly file and if the components need to be replaced within the file in order to show the correct assembly of the object.
