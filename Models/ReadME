WARNING: In additon to the model parts, I included altered Toolbox parts from Solidworks as well as there was an issue with the assembly file when it came to saving these alterations as it keeps reverting back to its original size every time I open up the file. Thus, I figured out that I must replace the components every time I open the assembly file, using the Replace Component or Part command to portray the correct version of the assembly.
